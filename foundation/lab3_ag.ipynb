He's been with Quest-Global, Memstech, Infolks. His technical skills also include working with specific hardware boards (RZV2L, RZV2H, etc.) and using RAG chatbots, FAISS, Pinecone. \n",

      "So the response should start with his professional identity, then his core skills and experience, mention the companies he worked for, highlight key projects and technologies, and conclude with his interests.
